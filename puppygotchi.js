// Create a Tamagotchi-style simulator for your new friend, Puppo.

// Puppo needs to be:
// - fed 3x a day
// - given water 5x a day
// - be taken out to pee 10x a day (legit)
// - be taken out to poop 3x a day
// - sleep 3x a day
// - walked 3x a day (which can include potty breaks!)
// - play as much as possible

// Puppo:
// - will not eat if she is full
// - will not drink if she needs to pee
// - will not poop if she has an empty tummy
// - will not nap if she hasn't played enough
// - cannot regulate her own states of being
// - will warn you about her needs if you ask nicely
// - may not warn you about ALL of her needs at once
