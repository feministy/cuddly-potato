// Fridays are clearly the best days, so I want to know as much about them as I
// can for 2020.

// You may use an external library to help with counting and parsing months/days,
// but you may not use any built in functionality that would do this for you.

// Your code should:
// - tell me how many Fridays are in 2020
// - tell me which month has the most Fridays (and how many there are)
// - tell me which month has the fewest Fridays (and how many)
// - if there is a tie for most (or fewest), tell me all of the months

// January 1, 2020 is a WEDNESDAY
// 2020 IS a leap year
